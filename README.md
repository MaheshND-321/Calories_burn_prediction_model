# Calories Burn Prediction with XGBoost Regressor and Flask

Welcome to the README file for the Calories Burn Prediction project! This project focuses on developing a predictive model using the XGBoost regressor to estimate the calories burned during a workout. The project is implemented using the Flask framework, allowing users to input various parameters such as age, weight, heart rate, body temperature, and workout time through a form. The model then predicts the calories burnt based on these inputs.

## Project Overview

The Calories Burn Prediction project aims to provide users with a tool to estimate the calories burnt during a workout session. By leveraging the XGBoost regressor model, the project can make predictions based on input parameters related to the user's age, weight, heart rate, body temperature, and workout time. Flask is used to create a user-friendly web interface for input and prediction.

## Features

The Calories Burn Prediction project includes the following features:

- **Input Parameters**: Users can input various parameters such as age, weight, heart rate, body temperature, and workout time.

- **Calories Burn Prediction**: The XGBoost regressor model processes the input parameters and predicts the calories burnt during the workout.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Flask provides an easy-to-use web interface for users to interact with the model.
